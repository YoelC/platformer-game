# platformer-game
This is a platformer that is still work in progress.
The sprites are created by [rvros](https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero) and [waxx and ANtY](https://waxx.itch.io/shadow-mines-asset-pack). Both artists are equally amazing, I recommend checking them out! (I also did a bit of photoshop magic into the sprites, and the map itself)
